2. Click on the **GitHub** tab.
3. Enter the URL of this repository: `https://github.com/OMCHOKSI/TEXT-TO-IMAGE-GEN-AI`
4. Select the `text-to-image.ipynb` file.
5. Click on **Open Notebook**.

### Colab Setup

1. Make sure you have the correct runtime settings:
   - Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type**.
   - Select **GPU** as the hardware accelerator.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Requirements

- Google Colab (for running the notebook with GPU)
- List of required libraries (automatically installed in Colab)
